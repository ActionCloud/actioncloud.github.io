# GitHub Issue Tracker Viewer Page

The GitHub Issue Tracker Viewer Page is a visualization of the issue count when you use [GitHub Issue Tracker Action](). All the code is first from [vscode-issue-tracker](https://github.com/lannonbr/vscode-issue-tracker), and I modify it as a GitHub Action for easy use.
